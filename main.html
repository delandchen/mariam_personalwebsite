            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p> Hi! My name is Mariam. I love innovation and I hope to be apart of a company that embodies that as a
                core
                value. I have strong web development skills
                such as JavaScript, PostgresSQL, React, and NodeJS. I am a part of Girls Who Code, an organization that
                supports the increasing number of women in Computer Science.
                In my free time I like to cook, bake, watch anime & Kdramas, workout, and drink boba as often as I can.
                I
                can speak two langauges:
                Frecnh and Arabic. I also have the ability to play the clarinet with no hands and backflip on one leg.
