        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <p> Hi! My name is Mariam. I love innovation and I hope to be apart of a company that embodies that as a core
            value. I have strong web development skills
            such as JavaScript, PostgresSQL, React, and NodeJS. I am a part of Girls Who Code, an organization that
            supports the increasing number of women in Computer Science.
            In my free time I like to cook, bake, watch anime & Kdramas, workout, and drink boba as often as I can. I
            can speak two langauges:
            Frecnh and Arabic. I also have the ability to play the clarinet with no hands and backflip on one leg.</p>
